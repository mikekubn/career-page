### Next.js: Importing and Resizing SVGs in Styled Components

> _If you're using SVGs in your Next.js project with styled-components, you may encounter issues with importing and resizing images. I was personally surprised by this problem._

Example: Next.js: [Remove view box](https://github.com/mikekubn/next-removeViewBox-example)

I started by using the same method I was accustomed to in Create React App (CRA), but I immediately ran into an issue with SVG support in Next.js. Fortunately, there was a quick solution: [dangerously-allow-svg](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#dangerously-allow-svg). My typing.d.ts file looked like this:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

declare module '*.svg' {
  const src: string;

  export const ReactComponent: React.FunctionComponent<React.SVGProps<SVGSVGElement>>;

  export default src;
}
```

I searched for a solution to import and resize SVGs in my project. Although I found several approaches that worked, none suited my specific needs.

**Unsuccessful solutions for my use case:**

- [image-component](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/image-component)
- [svg-components](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/svg-components)

After a few hours of research, I discovered that the default option for removeViewBox is set to true. This caused the viewport of the SVG to revert to its default state whenever I changed the height or width.

The solution is to modify the Webpack configuration in _next.config.js_ and set removeViewBox to false. This will allow SVG resizing to work properly.

Hereâ€™s the Webpack configuration:

```.mjs
function webpack(config) {
  config.module.rules.push({
  loader: '@svgr/webpack',
  options: {
    prettier: false,
    svgo: true,
    svgoConfig: {
    plugins: [{
      name: 'preset-default',
      params: {
      overrides: { removeViewBox: false },
      },
    },
  ],
 },
  titleProp: true,
 },
  test: /\.svg$/,
 });
 return config;
}
```

#### Note

_If you're using .babelrc with inline-react-svg, this solution will not work for you._
