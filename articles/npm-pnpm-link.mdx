### How to use npm link with pnpm and handle overwrites?

> _If you're working on a larger project with multiple packages, you might want to use pnpm for better performance and efficiency._

```json

"pnpm": { "overrides": { "my-package-foo": "3.4.0" } }

```

### What is pnpm?

- pnpm is an alternative to npm (Node Package Manager), designed to be faster and more efficient.
- When I first started using pnpm, I ran into issues while trying to link local packages where my main project used pnpm and other local packages used the standard npm. When I attempted to link packages using npm link or pnpm link, I frequently encountered errors stating that the package did not exist.
- To address this, I’ve outlined some steps for successfully using package linking with pnpm and handling overrides.

### Steps:

- Linking with npm: In the repository where you are using npm, type npm link. Then, go to your main project, where the linked package is used, and run the following command:

  ```bash
  npm link <package-name-from-package.json>
  ```

- That’s it for the repository using npm.
- Linking with pnpm (with overrides): If you're using pnpm with overrides, and you want to override the package version, modify the package.json like this:

  ```bash
  "overrides": "link:../foo-basic"
  ```

- Make sure to point the path to the package directory, not the dist folder. Then, run pnpm install _(pnpm i)_ to apply the changes.

#### Note:

_If you're using VS Code, you may need to reload your IDE after linking packages. You can do this by going to Developer > Reload Window._
