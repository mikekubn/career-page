### Next.js import and resize SVG in styled components

> _If you want to use **SVG** in your Next.js project with **styled components** you can find problem with import and resize image. I personally surprised by this problem._

Example: [Next.js with styled components resize SVG](https://github.com/mikekubn/next-removeViewBox-example)

I started the same way I was used to using in CRA, but immediately ran into an issue regarding SVG support in Next.js but it had a quick solution [Dangerously Allow SVG ](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#dangerously-allow-svg). My `typing.d.ts` file looked like this:

```ts
declare module '*.svg' {
  import React from 'react';

  const src: string;

  export const ReactComponent: React.FunctionComponent<React.SVGProps<SVGSVGElement>>;
  export default src;
}
```

I was looking for some solution for import, resize SVG in my project. I found several solutions that works, but it no worked for my purposes.

**Successful solution but neither worked for my purposes**

- [# Image Component Example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/image-component)
- [# SVG components example with SWC](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/svg-components)

After a few hours of researched, I discovered that the default option for `removeViewBox` is set to `true`. When I changed the height or width in the SVG, the viewport from the SVG returned to the default state. **The solution** is edit the webpack configuration in `next.config.js` and set `removeViewBox` to `false` SVG resizing will work.

```js
webpack(config) {
  config.module.rules.push({
    loader: '@svgr/webpack',
    options: {
      prettier: false,
      svgo: true,
      svgoConfig: {
        plugins: [
          {
            name: 'preset-default',
            params: {
              overrides: { removeViewBox: false },
            },
          },
        ],
      },
      titleProp: true,
    },
    test: /\.svg$/,
  });

  return config;
}
```

##### Note

If you are using `.babelrc` with `inline-react-svg`, this solution will not work for you.
